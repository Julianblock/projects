## 🛡 Why You Won’t See Much Code

Most of my production work has been developed under **NDA**, powering **enterprise-grade systems** for fintech, logistics, cannabis, e-commerce, and AI research sectors.  
Due to the nature of my contracts and IP sensitivities, much of the source code can't be made public — but what I *can* share are **deep-dive case studies** detailing:

- The **architecture** I designed  
- The **technologies** I implemented  
- The **business problems** I solved  
- And the **real-world impact** these systems delivered

Each case study below highlights **how I think**, **what I build**, and **why it matters**.
