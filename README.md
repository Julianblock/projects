## 🛡 Why You Won’t See Much Code

Most of my production work has been developed under **NDA**, powering **enterprise-grade systems** across:

- 🚛 **Logistics**
- 🧾 **Fintech & Payments**
- 🧬 **Cannabis & Wellness**
- 🎥 **Media Streaming**
- 🧠 **AI R&D**

Due to IP sensitivity, the source code remains private.  
But what I *can* share are **deep-dive case studies** that detail:

- The **architecture** I designed  
- The **technologies** I implemented  
- The **business problems** I solved  
- And the **real-world outcomes** these systems delivered

Each case study here shows **how I think**, **how I build**, and **why it mattered** to the companies I served.
